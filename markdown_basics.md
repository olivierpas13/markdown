# Markdown basics
## Different types of headers

1. To write different types of headers we have to use '#':
* For a **h1 title** we would write **"# first title"**
* For and **h2 title** we would write **"## second title"**
* We can continue adding **more** titles by adding more hashes.

## Different types of text

1. For italic text we can use "*" sorrounding the word
* *This is a text written in italic*

2. For strong text we can use "**" sorrounding the word
* **This is a strong text**

3. For strikethrough we can use "~~" sorrounding the word
* ~~Strikethrough example text~~

## To create an ordered list
- We have to use "1.", "2.", and so on.
1. First
2. Second
3. Third
- You can make nest lists
